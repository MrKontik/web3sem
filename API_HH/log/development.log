Failed to call `:create_job` on #<Types::MutationType:0x000001e7ba319e78 @object=nil, @context=#<Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `company: 5` was given by GraphQL but not defined in the Ruby method. Add `company:` to the method parameters.
- `company_id:` is required by Ruby, but not by GraphQL. Consider `company_id: nil` instead, or making this argument required in GraphQL.
